I build and lead technology systems that are meant to work in the real world.

My work has focused on designing platforms and organisations where software, data, and people come together at scale. Over time, I have worked across large enterprises and startups, building and leading distributed engineering teams, and partnering closely with product, operations, and business leaders to turn ideas into systems that customers and operators can rely on every day.

I care deeply about how systems behave under pressure. Early exposure to ethical hacking shaped how I think about security, trust, and accountability. It taught me that strong systems are built with humility, that failure modes matter as much as features, and that reliability is a leadership responsibility, not just a technical one. This mindset continues to guide how I approach architecture, quality, and decision making.

As a leader, I focus on clarity. Clear goals, clear ownership, and platforms that reduce cognitive load for teams. Well designed systems allow engineers to move with confidence, operators to trust what they see, and leaders to focus on what they want to build next rather than worrying about whether the foundations will hold.

Data and AI are increasingly central to this way of thinking. Not as trends, but as practical tools to improve judgement. I am particularly interested in how trustworthy data and thoughtfully applied AI can create shared understanding, enable better decisions, and help organisations operate with calm confidence instead of reactive urgency.

I am drawn to work with tangible impact. Technology that supports energy, logistics, infrastructure, and everyday livelihoods. Systems that quietly do their job well, improve access and efficiency, and create value without demanding constant attention.

Outside of work, I enjoy building things with my hands as much as with code. During the COVID period, I spent personal time making hand sanitizers for friends and family. That curiosity later evolved into a deeper interest in formulation and quality, and today I spend time creating soaps simply because I enjoy the process of making something useful, honest, and well crafted.

I also enjoy movies, cricket, snooker, and long conversations that drift from philosophy to everyday life. I value simplicity, good judgement, and people who care about their craft.
